    This Final Degree Project focuses on the <strong>development of an application for mobile devices with Android
      operating system</strong> that allows users to <strong>manage their routines, set body weight goals, calculate
      possible weights to move and consult personal statistics</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although there are currently numerous applications with this or similar functionality, there is no application
    that brings them all together. This work tries to explain the process <strong>carried out for the development and
      implementation of both the client side and the server side</strong>. The client side corresponds to the
    application
    interface with which users interact, while the server side is divided into two databases, one relational,
    persistent and managed with MySQL and the other nonpersistent, non-relational and managed with Redis, and two
    servers, one of them acting as an authentication server and the other as an application server.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, it tries to explain the technologies used during the development, the tests carried out to check
    that the system works as expected and correctly will be discussed.
  </p>

  <p>
    To develop the client side, <strong>Android Studio was used as the development environment and Kotlin as the
      programming
      language</strong>. For the server side, regarding the development of the <strong>two servers and their application
      programming
      interfaces (APIs)</strong>, Express.js was used, a framework written in JavaScript and hosted within the Node.js
    execution environment. And with regard to the databases, <strong>two databases were used</strong>, a database that
    stores the
    information created and consulted by the two servers and another database hosted on the application server that
    acts as a cache memory.
