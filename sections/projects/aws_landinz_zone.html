  <h1>Deployment of a Landing Zone under a Hub-and-Spoke Architecture in AWS</h1>

  <img src="assets/projects/aws_landing_zone.webp" alt="AWS Landing Zone">

  <p>This project focuses on the design and deployment of a <strong>Landing Zone</strong> in AWS, utilizing a
    <strong>Hub-and-Spoke Architecture</strong> to establish a secure and scalable cloud infrastructure. The Landing
    Zone was designed to facilitate centralized resource management and structured organization, supporting both
    development and production environments.
  </p>

  <p>The primary goal of the project is to create an efficient and automated infrastructure configuration that
    accelerates deployment cycles, reduces configuration errors, and improves operational reliability. The project
    includes an initial manual setup phase to familiarize with AWS services, followed by full automation using
    Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like <strong>Terraform</strong> and <strong>Bash</strong> scripting.</p>

  <h2>Infrastructure Overview</h2>

  <h3>High Level Design</h3>

  <img src="assets/projects/Architecture.png" alt="AWS Landing Zone Arch">

  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>The infrastructure is designed around three distinct environments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Production:</strong> A dedicated environment with isolated VPCs for running live workloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Development:</strong> A mirrored environment to Production for testing and development purposes, with
      CIDR blocks adjusted to avoid overlap.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared:</strong> A centralized VPC that hosts common resources such as AWS service endpoints, DNS
      configurations, and other shared services accessible by both Production and Development environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Network Architecture</h3>
  <p>The Hub-and-Spoke architecture ensures each VPC has a clear role:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shared VPC:</strong> Contains AWS endpoints (e.g., S3, DynamoDB), which are shared across other VPCs.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Hub VPC:</strong> Acts as the core network connection point, providing routing to Spoke VPCs.</li>
    <li><strong>Spoke VPCs:</strong> Include subnets for <em>Front</em>, <em>Back</em>, and <em>Data</em> tiers, each
      hosting specific EC2 instances or services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Purpose and Methodology</h2>

  <p>The purpose of this project is to establish a <strong>modular and replicable cloud infrastructure</strong> that can
    be easily managed and scaled across different environments. The methodology used for deployment includes two main
    milestones:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Manual Deployment Phase:</strong> Designed to become familiar with AWS services and manually configure key
      resources such as VPCs, subnets, and peering connections.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automated Deployment Phase:</strong> <strong>Terraform</strong> was used as an Infrastructure as Code
      (IaC) tool to automate provisioning processes, complemented by <strong>Bash scripting</strong> to optimize
      workflows.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The main components of the Landing Zone include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shared VPC:</strong> Hosts shared services such as AWS endpoints and private DNS.</li>
    <li><strong>Hub VPC:</strong> Centralized environment for managing shared services and connecting to Spoke VPCs.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Spoke VPCs:</strong> Isolated environments designed to host development and production workloads.</li>
    <li><strong>Route tables:</strong> Configured to direct traffic between VPCs via peering connections while
      maintaining strict control over the allowed routes to ensure security and isolation.</li>
    <li><strong>VPC Peering:</strong> Establishes secure interconnection between the Hub and Spokes, enabling
      communication while ensuring no unnecessary traffic flows between unrelated VPCs.</li>
    <li><strong>Endpoints:</strong> Deployed in the Shared VPC and shared across all Spoke VPCs, allowing
      efficient access to services like S3 and EC2 without traversing the public internet.</li>
    <li><strong>NACLs</strong> and <strong>Security Groups:</strong> Configured with reusable, centralized rules to
      manage inbound and outbound traffic across subnets and instances, reducing redundancy while enforcing strict
      security controls.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure Parameters:</strong> Managed in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as encrypted
      <strong>SecureString</strong> values, ensuring sensitive data such as SSH keys and credentials are securely stored
      and accessed programmatically.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Features of This Deployment</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> Allows the addition of new VPCs or subnets easily to scale based on
      organizational needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Terraform ensures consistency and reduces human error in infrastructure
      configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and Governance:</strong> Implements AWS best security practices, including Network ACLs,
      Security Groups, and private hosted zones.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Bash scripts optimize Terraform workflows, automating repetitive tasks and reducing
      execution time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Evaluation and Results</h2>

  <p>To assess the success of this deployment, the infrastructure was tested in a controlled environment simulating real
    production and development needs. The evaluation revealed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consistent Resource Deployment:</strong> Automation with Terraform ensured identical configurations
      across all environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The hub-and-spoke architecture allowed the addition of new VPCs and subnets
      without reconfiguring the base infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduction in Configuration Errors:</strong> Automated processes minimized human intervention, increasing
      deployment reliability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Benefits</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Centralized Resource Management:</strong> Centralized control of shared services within the Landing
      Zone.</li>
    <li><strong>Accelerated Deployment Cycles:</strong> Automation tools enabled faster provisioning and updates.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Security and Governance:</strong> Compliance with AWS best practices provided a secure
      foundation for critical applications.</li>
  </ul>
