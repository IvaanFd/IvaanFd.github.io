    On my GitHub profile, youâ€™ll find a <strong>collection of projects related to cybersecurity, designed to be both
      practical and insightful</strong>. These repositories reflect my interest and commitment to developing tools that
    explore
    various aspects of cybersecurity, from creating functional utilities to experimenting with key technical
    concepts.

  <h2>Featured Projects</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Secure Password Generator:</strong> A tool designed to create strong passwords, ideal for securing
      accounts and systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Port Scanner:</strong> A script to analyze and detect open ports on devices, useful for identifying
      potential access points.</li>
    <li><strong>Keylogger:</strong> An educational program that demonstrates how keyloggers work, highlighting their
      importance in threat detection.</li>
    <li><strong>Reverse Shells:</strong> Multiple implementations of reverse shells, including a Python version
      (with client and server scripts) and a Bash version, showcasing fundamental techniques for remote network
      communication.</li>
    <li><strong>CipherVault:</strong> Desktop graphical application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files
      using the AES-512 encryption algorithm. Users can generate public/private key pairs and use these keys
      to encrypt or decrypt files.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Although my portfolio is currently modest, I <strong>plan to expand it with new projects</strong> as I continue
    developing tools
    and exploring various areas of cybersecurity. Each new advancement will be shared on my profile, creating a
    space for continuous growth and learning.
