  <p>
    The Master’s Thesis focuses on the design of an own methodology to perform infrastructure security audits. This new
    methodology comprises several phases aimed at carrying out an exhaustive assessment, with the objective of
    identifying as many vulnerabilities as possible and thus guaranteeing the security of the audited organization’s
    infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of this methodology is to make it accessible and easy to apply, especially for those who are just
    starting out in the cybersecurity sector. It is composed of five phases: Planning and preparation, Information
    gathering, Exploitation, Threat assessment and Reporting. It is based on a system of verifications or checks,
    structured in the form of a checklist, which guides the actions to be taken according to the scenario and situation
    in which the auditor is. This distinguishes it from other existing methodologies that only explain the phases in a
    general way.
  </p>

  <p>
    To evaluate the effectiveness of this new methodology, it will be applied in a laboratory environment as realistic
    as possible, consisting of three machines. One of these machines, developed in-house, has a Unix architecture and
    presents several vulnerabilities. The other two are Windows architecture machines equipped with Active Directory,
    available on the Try Hack Me platform.
