            <span class="highlight">IT Strategy Consultant at Kyndryl</span>
            <p>I started my professional career at Kyndryl as part of the 2024
              promotion of the Horizon talent program.

              The first project engagement involved the design and implementation of a Landing Zone on AWS,
              using a Hub-and-Spoke architecture to achieve a secure and scalable cloud infrastructure.
              The project included full automation using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform
              and Bash scripting.

              During the second assignment I was involved in a project of migration and validation
              of machine learning models from on-premise environments to Google Cloud for one of the
              main national banking institutions. The process included the refactoring of the code to
              make it compatible with a more modern version of Kedro, as well as its adaptation for
              execution in the cloud. In addition, in-depth validations were carried out to ensure the
              consistency of the results between on-premise and cloud environments.

              After the completion of the digital transformation project, I started participating
              in an identity management project for Naturgy, focused on user administration and access
              control to internal resources using Azure Entra ID. My responsibilities included group
              and conditional access policy management, Exchange administration and MFA compliance monitoring.
              For the latter, I held meetings with internal managers, explaining the need for its
              configuration and presenting viable alternatives for its implementation.

              In parallel to my participation in the digital transformation project for the bank,
              I was contributing in the design and implementation of the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
              of SegurCaixa Adeslas (SCA), with the aim of ensuring the operational continuity of its
              critical systems. Currently he continues to collaborate with the SCA resilience team
              in the identification of technological risks, the definition of recovery strategies
              and the definition of incident response procedures that may affect the IT infrastructure
              and the applications it supports.

              In parallel to my involvement in projects that have a direct impact on Kyndryl's business,
              I promoted an internal initiative focused on financial education. The goal is to raise
              awareness of the importance of actively managing personal finances and investing wisely,
              rather than letting money sit idle. This initiative is still active and includes talks that
              I have personally given, collaboration with external experts for specialized seminars and
              the monthly publication of content in the form of internal posts.</p>
